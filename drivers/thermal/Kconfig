menuconfig THERMAL
	tristate "Generic Thermal sysfs driver"
	help
	  Generic Thermal Sysfs driver offers a generic mechanism for
	  thermal management. Usually it's made up of one or more thermal
	  zone and cooling device.
	  Each thermal zone contains its own temperature, trip points,
	  cooling devices.
	  All platforms with ACPI thermal support can use this driver.
	  If you want this support, you should say Y or M here.

config THERMAL_HWMON
	bool
	depends on THERMAL
	depends on HWMON=y || HWMON=THERMAL
	default y

config THERMAL_MONITOR
	bool "Monitor thermal state and limit CPU Frequency"
	depends on THERMAL_TSENS8960 || THERMAL_TSENS8974
	depends on CPU_FREQ_MSM
	default n
	help
	  This enables thermal monitoring capability in the kernel in the
	  absence of a system wide thermal monitoring entity or until such an
	  entity starts running in the userspace. Monitors TSENS temperature
	  and limits the max frequency of the cores.

config SPEAR_THERMAL
	bool "SPEAr thermal sensor driver"
	depends on THERMAL
	depends on PLAT_SPEAR
	help
	  Enable this to plug the SPEAr thermal sensor driver into the Linux
	  thermal framework
