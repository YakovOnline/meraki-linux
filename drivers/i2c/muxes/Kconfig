	depends on GENERIC_GPIO
	help
	  If you say yes to this option, support will be included for a
	  GPIO based I2C multiplexer. This driver provides access to
	  I2C busses connected through a MUX, which is controlled
	  through GPIO pins.

	  This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called gpio-i2cmux.

config I2C_GPIO_SCL
       boolean "GPIO-based SCL multiplexer"
       depends on I2C_GPIO
       help
         If you say yes to this option, support will be included for a
         GPIO based I2C multiplexer and adapter, where the method of
         multiplexing is multiple I2C busses with separate SCL lines
         and a shared SDA line. This driver relies on the i2c-gpio
         driver to handle communication across the busses.

         This driver cannot be built as a module yet.
